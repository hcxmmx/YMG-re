            "text": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sunlight is made of all colors:** White sunlight is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow.\n\n*   **Entering the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering:** This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n\n*   **Shorter wavelengths scatter more:** Rayleigh scattering is more effective at shorter wavelengths of light. Blue and violet light have the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum.\n\n*   **Blue dominates:** Because blue light is scattered more strongly than other colors, it's scattered all over the sky. This is why we see a blue sky.\n\n*   **Why not violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue, the sun emits less violet light, and our eyes are also less sensitive to violet. Therefore, blue is the predominant color we perceive.\n\n**In short:** Blue light from the sun is scattered more than other colors by the air molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, making the sky appear blue."
