Decades of storms, shipwrecks, and the endless, unforgiving sea. But tonight, something was different. The fog was thicker than usual, a suffocating blanket muffling the foghorn's mournful cry. Then, a whisper on the wind. Not the howl of a gale, but a child's giggle. He strained his ears, peering into the swirling grey.

The sea held secrets, he knew, and tonight, it was sharing one.\n"}],"role":"model"},{"parts":[{"text":"What is the title of the story?"}],"role":"user"}],"generationConfig":{}}
