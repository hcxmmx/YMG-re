Today was Thomas's birthday. He'd always loved her star-shaped cookies. Years ago, heâ€™d sailed away, promising to return.\n\nSuddenly, the bell above the door jingled. A weathered sailor, his face obscured by a dripping hat, stepped inside. \"Do you still make star cookies?\" he rasped.\n\nMrs. Higgins' heart leaped.

He was home.\n"}],"role":"model"},{"parts":[{"text":"What is the title of the story?"}],"role":"user"}],"generationConfig":{}}
